==== Prepare your AWS account

===== Key Pair 
Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in the Region where you plan to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair name. You need it during deployment. To create a key pair, follow the instructions in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[AWS documentation]. +
For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair instead of using one thatâ€™s already being used by a production instance.
