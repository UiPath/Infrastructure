{partner-product-short-name} is a web application that enables you to securely schedule, manage and control your enterprise-wide digital workforce of UiPath Robots.

Orchestrator lets you manage the creation, monitoring, and deployment of RPA resources in your environment, acting as an integration point with third-party solutions and applications.

UiPath Orchestratorâ€™s power comes from its capability of managing your entire Robot fleet. Attended, Unattended or Nonproduction, they can all be connected and executed from this centralized point.

*	*Attended* - This type of Robot is triggered by user events, and operates alongside a human user, sharing the same workstation. Attended Robots are used with Orchestrator for centralized process deployment and logging. They can also add data into a queue, to be processed by Unattended robots.
*	*Unattended* - Robots run unattended in virtual environments and can automate any number of processes. On top of the Attended Robot capabilities, the Orchestrator is responsible for remote execution, monitoring, scheduling and providing support for work queues.
*	*Development* - has the capabilities of an Unattended Robot but intended only for development purposes.
*	*Nonproduction* - similar to Unattended Robots but intended only for development and testing purposes.

You are able to run debugging in UiPath Studio with all types of Robots.
