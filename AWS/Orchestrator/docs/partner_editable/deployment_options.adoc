This Quick Start provides a single deployment option:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.

This Quick Start only provides end-to-end deployment option, meaning it builds a new VPC, set of Subnets, NAT Gateways, Internet Gateway, Security groups, Bastion host and other components for you. In order to setup the complete networking and routing infrastructure you need to provide only the CIDR block for the VPC that you wish to create.

The Quick Start provides templates for this option. It however lets you configure instance types and software settings such as license keys, user names and passwords, as discussed later in this guide.
