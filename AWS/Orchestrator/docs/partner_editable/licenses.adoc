This Quick Start requires separate licenses for UiPath. To use the Quick Start in your production environment, contact UiPath sales team and sign up for a license at https://www.uipath.com/company/contact-us. When you launch the Quick Start, provide the license keys for Orchestrator and HAA component as input parameters to the CloudFormation stack. If no license keys are provided, the deployment is not affected but you will need to manually license the components after the stack was created.

If you want to try the product before purchasing, you can request a trial license at https://www.uipath.com/developers/studio-download. The trial license gives you 60 days of free usage in a non-production environment. After this time, you can upgrade to a production license.
